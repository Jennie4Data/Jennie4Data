# Hello! I'm Jenn.👋

I have a deep love for data and a high level of proficiency in various data tools. My expertise encompasses just the use of tools but logic and the quest to solve problems. Through my extensive experience, I have honed my skills in extracting, analyzing, and visualizing data, allowing me to uncover valuable insights and drive informed decision-making. Whether it's manipulating databases using SQL, conducting advanced data analysis in Excel, creating interactive dashboards in Power BI and Tableau, or leveraging Python/R for data modeling and machine learning, I thrive on harnessing the power of data to derive meaningful outcomes.
Tools, I use;
  - SQL
  - Excel
  - Tableau
  - Power BI
  - Python
  - R

👀   So, yeah I'm a data analyst.

🌱 I’m currently learning everything Data.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Data gigs.
